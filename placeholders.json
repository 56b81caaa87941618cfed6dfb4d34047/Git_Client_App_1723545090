    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_ANSWER_TEXT_1": "Isomorphic git allows you to use the same codebase for the client and server sides of your git repositories. It provides a unified model for syncing code across different platforms.",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_QUESTION_TEXT_2": "Why use isomorphic git?",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_ANSWER_TEXT_2": "Isomorphic git simplifies development by letting you share logic between client and server. This reduces code duplication and makes your codebase more maintainable. It also improves performance by rendering on the server.",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_QUESTION_TEXT_3": "How do I get started with isomorphic git?",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_ANSWER_TEXT_3": "First, install our isomorphic git framework. Then, structure your codebase using our universal rendering approach. Our guides have examples to help you set up routing, data fetching, and more.",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_QUESTION_TEXT_4": "What platforms does isomorphic git support?",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_ANSWER_TEXT_4": "Isomorphic git works with Node.js for the server environment and can target modern browsers, React Native, and other javascript runtimes on the client side.",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_QUESTION_TEXT_5": "Is isomorphic git production ready?",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_ANSWER_TEXT_5": "Yes, isomorphic git is battle-tested and used by major companies and open source projects. We follow semantic versioning and maintain backwards compatibility for stable releases.",
    "PLACEHOLDER_FAQ_TITLE": "Frequently Asked Questions about Isomorphic Git",
    "ACCORDION_QUESTION_1": "What is Isomorphic Git?",
    "ACCORDION_ANSWER_1": "Isomorphic Git is a revolutionary new approach to version control that allows seamless collaboration across different platforms and environments. It bridges the gap between client-side and server-side development, enabling developers to work more efficiently and consistently.",
    "ACCORDION_QUESTION_2": "How does Isomorphic Git differ from traditional Git?",
    "ACCORDION_ANSWER_2": "Traditional Git is primarily designed for server-side version control. Isomorphic Git extends this functionality to the client-side, allowing developers to manage code changes and collaborate directly from their browsers or client applications.",
    "ACCORDION_QUESTION_3": "What are the benefits of using Isomorphic Git?",
    "ACCORDION_ANSWER_3": "Isomorphic Git offers several benefits, including improved developer productivity, reduced context-switching, better code consistency, and easier collaboration across teams and environments.",
    "ACCORDION_QUESTION_4": "Is Isomorphic Git compatible with existing Git workflows?",
    "ACCORDION_ANSWER_4": "Yes, Isomorphic Git is fully compatible with traditional Git workflows and repositories. It seamlessly integrates with existing Git tools and services, making the transition smooth and easy for developers already familiar with Git.",
